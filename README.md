Just for fun!



I'm thinking about how to do reverse index searches faster.

The plan is to keep the words and certain indexes in memory, and leave the rest of the data in a database.



I've provided some generated headers, but I think there are even better ways to do this.

I want to structure this in such a way that it would be simple enough to do the queries on a CPU, or on a GPU.



Oh, none of this is tested yet. I'll get to that eventually.

This is my "video-game time" until it works. Haha.
